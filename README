There are three strategies to generate queries of a time-varying graph.

1. Random ( genqueries-random.sh )
Choose a time and a node at random, for all kind of queries.

2. Different items for all queries ( genqueries.sh )
For each kind of query, choose a random change and generate a query

3. Same nodes and time for all queries ( genqueries-all.sh )
Choose k random changes, and create all queries over that set.
